I got fed up with multiple mods, so I combined them into one.

works with 3.8.3 for now. (will not work for 3.9.0)

BushWhacker
GrassCutter
EnvironmentEnjoyer
MasterKey
InventoryViewer
SpaceUser
TradingPlayerView - needs a fancy name
BotMonitor - Disabled for now

- BushWhacker
Disables collision with bushes, so you can run through them like the good old days

- GrassCutter
Disables Grass

- EnvironmentEnjoyer
Disables Trees and bushes (Looks mighty weird)

- MasterKey
Change all key doors to use a specific KeyCard for easy access

- InventoryViewer
Debug tool to see everything the corpses have on them (including prison wallet)

- SpaceUser
Adds ability to hit space to confirm splitting of stacks and buying from flea

- TradingPlayerView
Removes that stupid ass box that comes up when selling to a trader and you hover a junk box and it spams you saying items cant be sold

License allows anyone to use the code, just give credit is all I ask.

- TODO:
look into other ways to activate and deactivate gameobjects to avoid stutter.
fix up botmonitor.
